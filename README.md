## Future Features
- There should be an "evolve" option that allows you to select a pre-evolution of a Pokémon in your collection and "evolve" it. This should allow you to alter its moveset and other stats upon evolution.
- There should be an option to "release" a Pokémon, which will completely remove it from the database.
- There should be an option to "transfer" a Pokémon to a different game. (MAYBE THIS SHOULD JUST BE AN EDIT OPTION)
- A section where I can keep track of the mega evolution stones I have.

## Notes for me
